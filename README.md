## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MERN, Tailwind CSS.

I have used the MVC architecture for my application, used some CSS frameworks for the UI and added the authentication using the Passport.js


## Lessons Learned:

I have really soldified my full-stack app building knowledge after this app and also learnt so much about the authentication.
